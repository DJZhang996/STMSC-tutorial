The development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies has revolutionized the way we map the complex organization and functions of tissues. These technologies offer valuable insights into the organization and function of complex biological systems. However, existing methods often focus too narrowly on single modalities or resolutions, thereby hindering the comprehensive capture of multi-layered biological heterogeneity. STMSC is proposed as a multi-slice joint analysis framework featuring a pre-correction mechanism that enables the precise identification of complex spatial domains, advancing disease pathology insights. STMSC assumes that precise three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is essential for an in-depth investigation of tissue components and mechanisms. Incorporating hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) imaging data, STMSC enhances slice alignment accuracy in 3D reconstruction. By deconstructing microenvironments, it reconstructs fine-grained cellular landscapes and emphasizes collective cellular behavior in defining spatial domains. Its graph attention autoencoder with pre-correction balances biological information at different levels, improving the accuracy of spatial transcriptomic analyses. By analyzing consecutive tissue slices and pathological datasets, STMSC accurately reconstructs 3D structures and provides deeper insights into complex cancer environments. Specifically, STMSC captures intra- and inter-stage heterogeneity in cancer development, offering profound insights into the complexity of pathological tissue structures.
